ACORN Canada Healthy Home
===========

ACORN Canada is a membership based community organization that focuses on social justice and leadership development in low and moderate income communities across Canada. Our main project areas include: Healthy Homes, Remittance Justice, Digital Access To Opportunities, Raising the Minimum Wage and more.

This project looks to develop an interactive mapping platform that would display sub-standard housing complaints captured by a number of outreach techniques (door to door, flyers, on line eblasts, and more) that would be sent into the interactive map through text messaging and though a web browser. The information would include minimum criteria to be determined, such as: mold and pest infestation, unit disrepair, heat problems, and security issues. The data will be displayed on a Google Map. The purpose of the interactive map would be to expose the huge amount of housing problems that exist in large Canadian Cities. Toronto will serve as a pilot site with the aim of broadening the project to Ottawa and eventually nation-wide.
