Tom is currently trying to find a new house to move into for him, his wife Jane and his 1 year old baby, Jennifer. Tom is 30 years old and Jane is 28 years old. Tom is a stay at home dad while Jane is a schoolteacher at a nearby school. An average weekday starts at 7 A.M when Jane gets ready for work and Tom prepares breakfast while noting things to do for the day. Jane leaves for work by 8 A.M and Tom continues the day following his to-do list. Tom loves cooking, hiking and photography, and he aspires to be a chef one day. 

Unfortunately for Jane, their current home (in Scarborough) is a 90 minute commute to her work which is in Mississauga. Another problem is that Tom's parents live closer to Mississauga in an elderly home. This is a hassle for him especially because he visits them regularly to keep them company.

Tom has been thinking of moving to Mississauga for some time now but since his family has to rely on a low income, his options are limited to cheaper apartments. He wants the best for his family and finds it unacceptable to sign a lease without knowing if the apartment building has problems. He has internet access, but even a google search of the buildings he's interested in returns no detailed reviews or forum posts about the building itself.
