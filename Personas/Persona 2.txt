Adam is 32, and he doesn't want to live with his parents anymore. He plays drums for a metal band. He's played a significant amount of gigs around Toronto bars but he really doesn't make any money from performing. Adam's current financial situation is not great. He recently found a job waiting tables, but years of playing loud music have impaired his hearing, making work with customers more challenging. 

Last year he decided to cut down on buying musical gear, and consequently saved up enough money to finally move out from his parents house. He moved in into a house in Mississauga - the place is small, but the neighbors are musicians too and they don't mind him practicing music. 

Very quickly Adam discovered that the place has mice. At first he thought that the problem had to do with his poor housekeeping habits, but after talking to his neighbors, he found out that the entire house has been infested for a while. The landlord even called an exterminator once, but the mouse problem remains unsolved. 

The landlord seemed unresponsive to Adams complaints, so after long deliberation, Adam decided to move out from the infested house. His friends offered him to temporarily crash with them until he's able to find another place to stay.

One day Adam was approached ACORN representative, who handed him a pamphlet with instructions on complaining about the infestation problem. Adam still doesn't have an Internet connection, so was happy to find out that he can file a complaint by sending a text message. He wants to make sure others know about the problem with mice in the building and consequently he wants to pressure the irresponsible landlord to deal with the problem.
