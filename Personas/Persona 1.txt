Jane

Jane is a schoolteacher who works in Missisuaga. She is currently 60 years old and she has been passionate about teaching for 15 years. She lives alone in an apartment in Missisuaga but she finds it difficult to visit her sick mother. Her mother Ann suffers from severe Dementia and Jane is very concerned about her well-being. However, Ann is currently in an elderly home in Oakville, being regularly checked on a daily basis by Jane's sister, Mary.

Mary has been living in Oakville for ten years but she is planning to move to Alberta for to work at the Oil Sands. Jane believes that Mary should pursue her goals and as such has applied for jobs at schools in Oakville.

As a 60 year old woman, Jane has graying hair but can still see perfectly. However, she fell down her stairs about 4 months ago and possesses a severe limp. Since she needs to find an apartment in Oakville, she's concerned that her annual salary of $50,000 will be unable to sustain her mother's medical bills as well as allow her to live comfortably. Thus she has been looking into cheaper living situations, and the result has been detrimental to her.

She already signed a lease before realizing that the elevator in the building was out of order past the 5th floor, and her apartment was in the 7th floor. She has pestered her landlady, but her landlady says that it will cost Jane $1000 for her share to repair it. However, luckily for Jane she was able to use internet at her school to find out that ACORN Canada deals with such issues. She's not very tech savvy so she was delighted to find that ACORN had a simple form to fill out and submit online with nothing complicated about the process.
