Ken Li, Apartment Hunter

Ken is a Male who is 22 years old. He is a tall and lean man with unmistakable horn-rimmed glasses. Ken works as a freelance web designer, and he finds it difficult to get a job these days.

Ken's job opportunities are limited because his parents and him immigrated from Chine to Canada 4 years ago, and he has found it very difficult to interact in English. 

Ken's currently trying to find an apartment, but being low on funds severly limits his options. He is looking for a great deal but he understands the potential to be scammed into an apartment full of problems.

He searched online and found out that ACORN Canada has a Google Maps embedded with an overlay that shows problematic buildings. This served him perfectly as he could easily reference any apartment postings to see if the property is in good standing.
