###### With Michael, Monica, Noel, Shandheap, Yuqiong and Zhi

1. Read description of Healthy Homes project
2. Agreed on a basic set of questions to ask Judy:
	1. Can you walk us through a complaint life cycle, from collection to viewing on the website?
	2. How and in what formats are you collecting the complaints?
	3. How, by whom and in what formats are the complaints being entered into the system?
	4. In what formats is the information going to be displayed?
	5. Can you make a few (diverse) potential users of the service available to us?
	6. Can we schedule a date in the next week where the six of us can meet with you to introduce ourselves?
	7. What technologies are you using for your current website?

5. Noel volunteered to send Susan an email asking about the project deadline.
6. We agreed to try to use trello, google drive and google groups as tools to organize the group.

	1. Communicate in a timely manner.
	2. Define meetings with a specific agenda and time, to ensure we respect other priorities that members might have.
	3. Meet regularly â€” a scrum every few 2 or 3 days, and a longer meeting on the weekend.
